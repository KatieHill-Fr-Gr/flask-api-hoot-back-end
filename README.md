## About


This repository contains a Flask backend template for a blogging API. It was built as a learning project based on a General Assembly tutorial. It follows a modular structure using Flask blueprints to support scalability and maintainability, and implements token-based authentication with a user model, sign-up and sign-in routes, and JWT token generation. Dependencies are listed in the `requirements.txt` file for a quick and easy setup.

Install the dependencies:
